This script shows how to generate a grade book from the assignment reports exported from the [MATLAB® Grader™ application](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-grader.html). A grade book in this case refers to a list of students with a metric that defines how well they solved the problems within the assignemnt. It may show the number of problems they solved correctly or the mean percentage score they received for the problems.

This tool supports educators using MATLAB Grader who do not have access to MATLAB Grader within a learning management system. **If you have access to a Campus-Wide License and your university uses a learning management system (LMS) we strongly recommend to integrate MATLAB Grader into the LMS and to use the grade book provided by the LMS.** Refer to the documentation on [LMS Integration](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlabgrader/lms-integration.html) or ask your MathWorks® representative about this option.

## MATLAB Grader Access
**For instructors:** You can access MATLAB Grader using your MathWorks Account that is associated with a current MATLAB license. Log in at [grader.mathworks.com](grader.mathworks.com). <br>
**For learners:** Learners can participate in MATLAB Grader courses with a free MathWorks Account. Only the instructor needs a license. <br>
**For institutions:** Some additional features like the LMS integration are available with a Campus-Wide License or Community and Technical College License.

You can check whether your school has a Campus-Wide License here: https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-support-program/eligibility.html
If your account is not linked to a MATLAB license, you can get started for free with a [30-day trial](https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html).

## Setup 
To Run:
1. Import your data or use the example data provided. The Live Script explains how to generate the correct report from [grader.mathworks.com](grader.mathworks.com).
2. The script offers various ways to create the grade book e.g. allowing or not allowing late submissions, counting correctly solved problems or averaging percentage scores. Run all sections or just the sections generating the relevant metrics for your use-case.
