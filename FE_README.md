This script shows how to generate a grade book from the assignment reports generated in the [MATLAB® Grader™ application](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-grader.html). A grade book in this case refers to a list of students with a metric that defines how well they solved the problems within the assignemnt. It may show the number of problems they solved correctly or the mean percentage score they received for the problems.

This tool supports educators using MATLAB Grader that do not have access to MATLAB Grader within a learning management system. **If you have access to a campus-wide licenses and your university uses a learning managemnet system (LMS) we strongly recommend to integrate MATLAB Grader into the LMS and to use the grade book provided by the LMS.** Refer to the documentation on [LMS Integration](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlabgrader/lms-integration.html) or ask your MathWorks® representative about this option.


## Setup 
To Run:
1. Import your data or use the example data provided. The Live Script explains how to generate the correct report from [grader.mathworks.com](grader.mathworks.com).
2. The script offers various ways to create the grade book e.g. allowing or not allowing late submissions, counting correctly solved problems or averaging percentage scores.Run all sections or just the section generating the relevant metrics for your use-case.
